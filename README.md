# CPU_Scheduling_Algorithms
This project contains codes of 7 basic CPU Scheduling Algorithms in C++ to run on your terminal or code editor and it also has its gui which is made using python's Tkinter library.<br />
These Algorithms include:<br />
1.**FCFS**(**First Come First Serve**)<br />
2.**SJF**(**Shortest Job First**)<br />
3.**HRRN**(**Highest Response Ratio Next**)<br />
4.**SRTF**(**Shortest Remaining Time First**)<br />
5.**Premptive Priority Scheduling**<br />
6.**Non Premptive Priority Scheduling**<br />
7.**Round Robin** <br />

**Python_Library:**(**Tkinter**)<br />
